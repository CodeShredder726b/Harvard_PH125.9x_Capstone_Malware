# Malware
## Introduction
Malware, short for "malicious software", is a type of software designed to cause harm or damage to computer systems, networks, or devices. Malware can take various forms, including viruses, worms, Trojan horses, ransomware, spyware, adware, and others. Malware can be spread through various means such as email attachments, infected websites, or through exploiting security vulnerabilities in software or operating systems. Malware can cause a range of issues such as stealing personal information, encrypting files and demanding ransom, disrupting system operations, and causing damage to hardware or software components. As such, it is important to have proper security measures in place, such as antivirus software, firewalls, and regular software updates to protect against malware attacks.

### Dataset
The dataset *Malware static and dynamic features VxHeaven and Virus Total Data Set* [2] from the UCI Machine Learning Repository contains three csv. 

* staDynBenignLab.csv: 1086 features extracted from 595 files on MS Windows 7 and 8, obtained Program Files directory.
* staDynVxHeaven2698Lab.csv: 1087 features extracted from 2698 files of VxHeaven dataset.
* staDynVt2955Lab.csv: 1087 features extracted from 2955 provided by Virus Total in 2018.

The staDynBenignLab has all the features of typical non-threatening programs wheare as staDynVxHeaven2698Lab and staDynVt2955Lab are extracted features of malware programs from the databases of VxHeaven and Virus Total. 
The dataset provides static features like ASM, compiler version, operating system version, Hex dump and PE header [3] (portable executable) and dynamic features extracted from a cuckoo sandbox [4].
The dataset only contains windows specific programs and malware.

## Initial setup
Download the dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository Dataset and extract the containing csv files. Add a label to each of the csv, describing the class of program identified (e.g. class 0 for benign, class 1 for static malware features and class 2 for dynamic malware features).

## Goal
The dataset is used to explore and gain insight on how normal programs and malware differ in static and dynamic structure. Several machine learning algorithms to classify an unseen program as benign or malware (static or dynamic) are developed and compared.
Overall, the goal of this project is to improve our understanding of how malware differs from normal programs, and to develop effective techniques for automatically identifying and classifying malware based on its static and dynamic features.
